Hello  Raine
I miss you, I've missed you ever since you headed back home.
I'm so happy I met someone like you. Someone I can be vulnerable with.
I was ashamed to admit it face to face but you are my first one.
I wish we didn't have to live this far apart.
Don't forget you promised me to come back.
I'll be waiting.
